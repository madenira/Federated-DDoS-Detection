# Federated Learning Against DDoS Attack

## Project Overview
This project implements a federated learning approach to detect DDoS attacks in a wireless network environment using synthetic data. The solution uses PyTorch for model building and federated learning simulation.

## How to Run

### Step 1: Set up the Environment
1. Install Anaconda from [https://www.anaconda.com/](https://www.anaconda.com/).
2. Create a new environment:
    ```bash
    conda create -n federated_learning_env python=3.8 -y
    ```
3. Activate the environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate federated_learning_env
    ```
4. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
  conda install pandas numpy scikit-learn pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch

    ```

### Step 2: Run the Code
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the main script in Visual studio Code using the environment built in conda:
    ```bash
    python Complete_code.py
    ```

### Step 3: Output
- The code will generate synthetic data, simulate federated learning, and evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset.
