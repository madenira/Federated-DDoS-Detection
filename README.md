# Federated-DDoS-Detection
Leveraging federated learning to detect DDoS attacks in wireless networks while preserving data privacy. This project implements a federated learning approach to detect DDoS attacks in a wireless network environment using synthetic data. The solution uses PyTorch for model building and federated learning simulation.
